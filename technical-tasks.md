# GSG Code Academy Spring 2022 Application: Technical Tasks

In order to be considered for the technical test, **you must complete the following Coding and Typing tasks**. We will consider the completion and quality of ALL of these tasks when we make decisions on who to invite for the in-person interview.

The coding section is the longest section and will require the most time to complete.

**It will take time to complete these tasks.** We suggest having a consistent schedule over a few weeks to complete these lessons. If you ever get stuck or feel overwhelmed, ask for help on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TjzYPC6FfC), or drop by one of our campuses in person. We are very happy to help.

### How should you complete the tasks?

In order to complete the technical tasks, we strongly suggest you complete the following lessons, which are an introduction to Front End Web Development. **You should make sure you take the time to read and fully understand the concepts, and not just rush through to complete the challenges**.

**Let's get started!:**

0. [Installing a text editor](pre-requisites/00-installations.md)
1. [Introduction](pre-requisites/01-introduction.md)
1. [HTML & CSS](pre-requisites/02-html-css.md)
1. [Developer Tools pt 1](pre-requisites/03-dev-tools.md)
1. [HTML Project](pre-requisites/04-project.md)
1. [Javascript 1](pre-requisites/05-javascript-1.md)
1. [Javascript 2](pre-requisites/06-javascript-2.md)
1. [Developer Tools pt 2](pre-requisites/07-dev-tools-2.md)
1. [Javascript 3](pre-requisites/08-javascript-3.md)
1. [DOM Manipulation](pre-requisites/09-dom-manipulation.md)
1. [Clean Code](pre-requisites/10-clean-code.md)
1. [Javascript Project](pre-requisites/11-project-js.md)
1. After completing both the HTML and the JS project, you must fill out this form: [**PROJECT FORM**](https://airtable.com/shrDsyTLInSnd5t6t)
1. After completing the lessons, you must solidify your learning by [reaching 5kyu in JavaScript on CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com), and making sure you continue your FreeCodeCamp learning until you get 200 points (after doing the sections mentioned lessons 1-11).


The lessons have been carefully curated from amazing, open-source teaching resources - most notably [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

We have intentionally organized the orders of the steps in a way to structure your learning. We highly recommend that you follow the steps in the order they are listed.

In the technical test and the in-person technical interview you will be asked questions to check your knowledge and skills in these topics. **You will be tested on your general understanding of concepts, specific coding questions, and your understanding of your project code.** The best way to prepare for the in-person technical interview is by **completing these lessons thoroughly and honestly (i.e. no copying and pasting from Google!)**



## Typing:

Typing is very important skill in life and especially in coding. We ask that everyone does some typing practice in order to join the course.


1- [First click this link to join the GSG typing class](https://gsg-code-academy.typingclub.com/signup/F8KL56C)

2- By the application deadline, **complete as many lessons as you can in Typing Jungle Class**.

Each lesson should take less than 10 minutes to complete. The best way to improve your typing is to do a small amount, practising every day, rather than doing all of the lessons at once.


### Summary:

If you get invited to a technical test and then the interview:
- Your understanding of the concepts learnt will be tested so it is not in your benefit to copy and paste in order to acheive these goals. 
- **To pass the technical test and the interview you will need a solid understanding of the concepts learnt throughout the lessons.**
- If you successfully complete and understand all of the tasks listed, you will be in with a very good chance of getting into the Code Academy

Good Luck!
